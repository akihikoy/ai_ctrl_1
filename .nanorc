## Sample initialization file for GNU nano
## Please note that you must have configured nano with --enable-nanorc
## for this file to be read!  Also note that characters specially
## interpreted by the shell should not be escaped here.
##
## To make sure a value is not enabled, use "unset <option>"
##
## For the options that take parameters, the default value is given.
## Other options are unset by default.

## Use auto-indentation
 set autoindent

## Backup files to filename~
 set backup

## Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.
 set const

## Use cut to end of line with ^K by default
# set cut

## Set the line length for wrapping text and justifying paragraphs.
## If fill is negative, the line length will be the screen width less
## this number.
##
# set fill -8

## Enable ~/.nano_history for saving and reading search/replace strings.
# set historylog

## Use alternate keypad routines
# set keypad

## Allow multiple file buffers (using ^R inserts into separate buffer).
## You must have configured with --enable-multibuffer or --enable-extra
## for this to work.
##
## set multibuffer

## Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format
# set noconvert

## Don't follow symlinks when writing files
# set nofollow

## Don't display the help lists at the bottom of the screen
# set nohelp

## Don't wrap text at all
 set nowrap

## Set operating directory.  nano will not read or write files outside
## this directory and its subdirectories.  Also, the current directory
## is changed to here, so files are inserted from this dir.  A blank
## string means the operating directory feature is turned off.
##
# set operatingdir ""

## Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S)
# set preserve

## The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.
## This is an extended regular expression if your system supports them,
## otherwise a literal string.  Default:
# set quotestr "^([ 	]*[\|>:}#])+"
## if you have regexps, otherwise:
# set quotestr "> "
## You can get old nano quoted-justify behavior via:
# set quotestr "(> )+"

## Do extended regular expression searches by default
# set regexp

## Use smooth scrolling as the default
 set smooth

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.  This option
## does not properly have a default value.
##
# set speller "aspell -c"

## Allow nano to be suspended with ^Z
# set suspend

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0
# set tabsize 8

## Save automatically on exit, don't prompt
# set tempfile

## Disallow file modification, why would you want this in an rc file? ;)
# set view
